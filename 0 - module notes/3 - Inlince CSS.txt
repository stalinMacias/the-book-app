    As its name says, this method is by adding CSS Code inline a Component.....

    * It has to be used the property called "style".
    * This property accepts a JS with all the CSS properties defined inside it!

    
    Example:
    
        <form style={
            {
                padding: "20px",
                margin: "20px",
                backgroundColor: "white"
            }
        }> </form>
