    * Since my point of view this is the best and professional way of work with CSS

    There are a few steps you have to do before you can start to work with CSS Modules:

    * Before start:
    
    1.-   if you are working with a react-version below 2.0:
            Due to we will execute the command:
                npm run eject
            If you are working with git, you must commit all your changes befores execute the command above!

    1.- if you are working with a react-version 2.0+
        1.1 -   You only will have to follow the name convention:
                        [name].module.css   ---> Example:   form.module.css

        1.2 -   Add CSS classes to this file. Any valid CSS class name is acceptable, but it’s recommend to use camelCase for classes with more than one word.
                The reason for this is that you’ll access these classes later as properties of a JS object and, if you want to use the dot notation (e.g. yourObj.someProperty) 

        1.3 -   Import the module you’ve just created from within your component, like this:
                        import styles from ‘./data-grid.module.css’;

        1.4 -   To use a class defined in your module, just refer to it as a normal property from the styles object, like:
                        <header className={styles.header}>…</header>
        
        1.5 -   When your application runs, the class names in the rendered DOM will be automatically mangled to prevent global conflicts
